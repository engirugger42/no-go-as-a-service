# no-go-as-a-service
Shameless port of [No-as-a-Service](https://github.com/hotheadhacker/no-as-a-service) to Go.

Usage:
```bash
$ Make no.exe executable
$ ./no.exe
```

That's it. Make sure `reasons.json` is in the same directory. Additionally, you can add, remove, edit anything in `reasons.json`. 
Restart the program to reflect changes.
